__The Organization__

Since day one I found a welcoming developer community ready to help with any question that I had. Alongside with this, my mentors Dr. Michael Dietze and Alexis Helgeson always made time for answering my questions and reviewing my code. 

__Main challenges faced__

One of the challenges that I encounter was the the installation of [PEcAn](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan). Currently, there are [four ways to install PEcAn](https://pecanproject.github.io/pecan-documentation/develop/pecan-manual-setup.html). Via _Docker, r-universe, local installation and virtual machine (VM)_. Of all of these the only one that worked for me was the VM, which was easy to install but it lack certain capabilities like having sudo access to install new packages.    

Another major challenge that I faced was understanding how to configure the xml files for running [PEcAn's models](http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/~kooper/PEcAn/book/models/). Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out this quickly and it took me a lot of time obtaining the data outputs required for the development of the project. 

__Feedback to the organization__

From my perspective, something that could speed up development is having a PEcAn instance with all the necessary files (i.e xml files, data inputs) that can be run locally. Having this could facilitate novice developers to catch up with all the PEcAn's inner workings quickly and also could facilitate the communication between mentors and contributors since the model results are know in advance. 

__Final take__

Working with PEcAn was a challenging but rewarding experience that tough me how an organization with many collaborators work which I think will help me to develop and good scientific career.
